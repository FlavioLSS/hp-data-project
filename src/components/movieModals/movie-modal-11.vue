                         <h3>In Bhutan 1932, Newt Scamander helps a Qilin — a magical creature that can see into one's soul as well as the future — give birth. Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes, led by Credence Barebone, attack and kill the mother, and kidnap the newborn. Grindelwald subsequently kills the creature to harness its ability of precognition. However, unbeknownst to them, the Qilin has given birth to twins, the younger of which Newt is able to save. <br>

                    <h3>During their teenage years, Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald made a blood pact where they swore an oath never to fight each other - presumably as a fail-safe to ensure no rift were to set them apart in their grand endeavour to ignite the revolution between the magical and the non-magical aggregations wherein the former was intended to prevail in the end to mark an era of sovereignty over the latter, with Albus and Gellert spearheading it equally as unified leaders with neither wizard lesser or greater than the other. By 1927, Grindelwald still possessed the phial from this pact to protect it from Dumbledore, so that Dumbledore would not be able to ever attack him directly.[3] However, the pact worked both ways and was therefore a double-edged sword, as while it protected Grindelwald from Dumbledore, it also prevented Grindelwald himself from personally eliminating Dumbledore, the greatest threat to his cause.</h3>

                    <h3>In 1927, Gellert Grindewald told the Obscurial Credence Barebone, who had been searching for the family which had abandoned him, that he was a member of the Dumbledore family, and that they willingly discarded him. As a result of the abandonment, Credence was adopted by Mary Lou Barebone in New York, a descendant of the Scourers and leader of the New Salem Philanthropic Society. Barebone, who hated wizards, was aware of Credence's abilities, and abused him heavily as a result. Although he had escaped from her after being unmasked as an Obscurial, a wizard who had violently supressed his magic after attempting to hide it, Credence still wanted answers, and Grindelwald provided him with proof of his identity: a bird which had been following him was a phoenix, a mythological creature with strong ties to the Dumbledore bloodline.</h3>

                    <h3>Grindelwald is a Seer - this means he has the ability to see glimpses of the future - and he enhances this by killing the baby Qilin, harnessing its own powers of precognition. Through Dumbledore, Newt conveys this message to the rest of the team: "our best hope is to confuse him" by having several plans instead of one. Furthermore, none of the characters can know the full extent of the plan, as Grindelwald would find a way to use this to his advantage. Dumbledore thus gives every character a separate task (at times intertwining with another's) and watches everyone from afar, ever ready to decide the next move depending on the current situation.</h3>
